# Memory-Game
Lightweight memory matching game built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript in preparation for class.

Pretty simple color matching game. Built-in one second delay to prevent mindless clicking in search of colors. 

Uses Javascript scripts to process 'thinking' components and execution at certain conditions.

Possible upgrades could include:
Start Button, Reset Button (in lieu of refreshing the browser), and score tracking.
